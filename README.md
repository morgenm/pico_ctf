# Pico CTF Challenges
## What is this repo?
This GitHub repo contains my solutions to some PicoCTF challenges. I am focusing mostly on reverse engineering and some binary exploitation. I may add others later. Each challenge has its own directory and a README explaining my thought process. I removed files shared by PicoCTF since I do not own the code and executables they provide; however, I have kept code they have shared which I have modified.

## TODO
- [ ] Add READMEs for challenges I have completed but not written up
- [ ] Flesh out existing READMEs more and fix any mistakes
